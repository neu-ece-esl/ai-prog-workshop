# 🧠 AI-Enhanced Programming Education Workshop

## Overview

The *AI-Enhanced Programming Education Workshop* is designed for instructors who teach programming-oriented courses and are interested in integrating artificial intelligence (AI) tools into their pedagogy. The workshop explores how AI can shift the focus of programming education from syntax and implementation details to system design, intentional development, and collaborative project management. Through interactive demos and guided activities, participants will experience different levels of AI assistance—including code review, Copilot integration, auxiliary code generation, and agent-based tools—and learn how to translate those experiences into impactful classroom practices.

This GitHub repository serves as the **central resource hub** for the workshop. It contains all relevant materials, including example notebooks, demonstration code, activity templates, instructional media, and post-workshop resources. The repository is intended to support participants both during and after the event by providing everything needed to replicate, adapt, or extend the activities in their own teaching contexts.

## 🎯 Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Understand the evolving role of AI in programming education
- Explore multiple levels of AI programming assistance, from code review to agent-based systems
- Gain hands-on experience with tools such as GitHub Copilot and Claude
- Design classroom activities that meaningfully integrate AI support
- Reflect on the pedagogical shift from coding mechanics to design thinking and intent-driven development

## 🗓️ Logistics

- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Target Audience:** Instructors of programming-oriented university courses
- **Format:** Interactive, hands-on
- **Requirements for Participants:**
  - Basic familiarity with programming concepts
  - A laptop for participating in activities
  - (Optional) Access to:
    - GitHub Copilot in VS Code
    - Claude (for script generation)

---

## 🧭 Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into four sections, each combining technical exploration with pedagogical reflection.

---

### 1. Technical Overview (7 minutes)

Participants are introduced to four levels of AI programming assistance, each increasing in complexity and integration:

- **🔍 Code Review and Improvement**  
  Using AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to analyze, debug, and enhance existing code. Focus is placed on explanation, feedback, and code quality improvement.

- **🧠 Copilot Integration in VS Code**  
  Demonstrating GitHub Copilot’s contextual code completion to help scaffold and extend student code with intent-driven prompts.

- **⚙️ Auxiliary Code Generation**  
  Using large language models (e.g., Claude) for one-shot generation of scripts—e.g., data loaders, visualizations, and diagnostic utilities.

- **🧩 Agent Mode for Complex Projects**  
  Exploring how agentic AI systems can assist with larger, multi-file codebases. A live demonstration of a team-based project tool (e.g., user onboarding, team formation, collaboration chat) will illustrate the possibilities.

---

### 2. Philosophical Approach (5 minutes)

This session introduces a pedagogical shift:

- From **programmer** to **project team lead**
- From code-as-syntax to **code-as-design**
- From individual problem-solving to **collaborative, intent-driven development**
- From teaching "what the code does" to guiding "why the code should be"

Participants are encouraged to reframe programming education around design thinking, student agency, and meaningful AI collaboration.

---

### 3. Hands-on Activity (15–20 minutes)

Participants choose an AI assistance level—ideally one slightly above their current familiarity—and engage in:

- **Exploring a technology level**
- **Designing a classroom activity** that integrates AI
- **Using an AI assistant** to help build or test their design
- **Refining in small groups** with optional support
- **Preparing to share** with the wider group

---

### 4. Show & Tell / Reflection (15–20 minutes)

Participants present their activity ideas and reflect on:

- The impact of AI integration on student learning
- How these tools might reshape assignments and course design
- Challenges in assessment, fairness, or over-reliance
- Opportunities for deeper student engagement and ownership


---

## 🧰 Post-Workshop Resources

This repository is designed to support continued exploration and implementation after the workshop. Participants and contributors can:

- Access example notebooks and code used during the session
- Adapt AI-assisted classroom activity templates for their own courses
- Explore live demonstrations of agent-based collaboration tools
- Contribute to the evolving gallery of AI-generated educational artifacts
- Join follow-up discussions and peer working groups

We encourage continued experimentation and dialogue through optional follow-up meetings, where instructors can share experiences, refine activity designs, and collaboratively shape the future of AI-enhanced programming education.
