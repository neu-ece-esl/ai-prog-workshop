# ðŸ§  AI-Enhanced Programming Education Workshop

## Overview

This workshop explores how artificial intelligence (AI) tools are reshaping the way programming is taught at the university level. Through a series of structured activities and demonstrations, participants will gain hands-on experience with modern AI-assisted programming toolsâ€”ranging from intelligent code review to advanced agent-based systems.

Designed for instructors and educators, the workshop encourages a pedagogical shift from focusing solely on syntax and correctness toward cultivating studentsâ€™ skills in **design thinking**, **intentional coding**, and **project-level problem solving**. Participants will leave with tangible classroom activities and strategies that leverage AI meaningfully to support student learning.
