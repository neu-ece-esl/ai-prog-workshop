    "\n",
    "In this activity, we explore how AI ‚Äî such as ChatGPT ‚Äî can be used to review existing code, identify bugs, and suggest improvements. Instead of using AI to *write* code from scratch, we focus on using it as a **coach** that helps students **understand**, **debug**, and **refactor** code they are already working with.\n",

    "\n",
    "- They're first encouraged to **analyze it themselves**.\n",
    "- Then, AI can be used to provide **targeted hints** or **explanations**.\n",
    "- Students are expected to **reflect on** and **critically evaluate** AI‚Äôs suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach promotes:\n",
    "- Deeper understanding of algorithms and logic\n",
    "- Collaborative learning through discussion of AI output\n",
    "- A mindset of *debugging as discovery*, not just fixing\n"
