    "Explore how GitHub Copilot can support students during the coding process by suggesting context-aware completions, generating boilerplate code, and scaffolding code structures based on natural language prompts. This activity focuses on helping students engage more deeply with **design**, **testing**, and **debugging** by letting Copilot handle repetitive coding tasks.\n"

    "## 🎓 Pedagogical Framing\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Copilot isn't just a shortcut for writing code — it's a tool that can support how students **design** their solutions and express their **intent** clearly through code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructors can frame Copilot not as a solution engine, but as a collaborator in the design process:\n",
    "- Help students translate high-level **intent** (\"I want to cluster these points and visualize them\") into functional code.\n",
    "- Encourage learners to focus on the **design** of the overall solution rather than just syntax and boilerplate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shifts the emphasis from *\"getting the code to run\"* to:\n",
    "- **Designing** robust, readable, and purposeful code\n",
    "- Reviewing Copilot's suggestions to ensure they align with the student's original **intent**\n",
    "- Making **critical decisions** about whether to accept, reject, or revise Copilot's completions\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructors can guide students to use Copilot in a way that reinforces understanding, promotes ownership of code, and supports the development of good coding practices rooted in **design thinking**.\n"
